                Seoul, the capital city of South Korea has become a a popular tourist attraction and an example of rapid adoption of technology from such a small country 
                with an unfortune past. Korea has been through many wars, divison and a hot spot for former imperilistic nations like Japan. Now South Korea has become a 
                developed nation and Seoul is a highlight of that. Seoul is known for its population density and large downtown city landscape very similar to Tokyo, Japan.
                Seoul has become one of the largest cities in the world, and headquarters some the largest companies like Samsung and LG. Seoul itself produces so much South Korea's
                gross domestic product; over 20%!

            <h2 id="divide">The Divide</h2>
            <p>
                Despite Seoul being a "site to see" theres one thing that must be known about Korea as a whole, that it is divided into two countries: North Korea and 
                South Korea. This physical divide is made the DMZ or Demilitarized Zone where it is heavily gaurded 24/7. How did this happen? This occured after the Korean War
                in 1953, when both sides fought for their ideaologies of communism or democracy. The DMZ is also known as the 38th parallel and has remained as a tensely gaurded border
                for over 60 years. Each side may not cross the border unless authorization. South Korea stands as a thriving populated nation with buzzling cities on that side of the 
                parallel, whilst North Korea has remained a secluded and ominous nation on the other side of the border.

                    The Seoul Tower is the heart of the capital of South Korea. It is in most advertisements, tourist photos and postcards. It stands over the heart of the city
                where you view all of the beauty of Seoul. At night the tower doesn't sleep as it is lit up by powerful LED lights that across the city landscape. It is over 700
                feet tall and is the highest point in all of the city.

                You can visit one of the world's most famous borders with the Half-Day Korean DMZ Tour. This tour will take you around the safe parts of the DMZ and have a 
                glimpse of Korean history. The 38th parallel is the most heavily gaurded border in the world and is under 24/7 surveillance. The area is surrounded by a reserve of
                wildlife that both countries have agreed to leave alone. The tour lets you view North Korea from afar through the Dora Observatory and see the tunnels the North dug
                decades ago when they were anticipating an invasion.

                The beautiful Gyeongbokgung Palace is in northern Seoul and was the main royal palace of Joseon Dynasty and the largest palace in Korea. The palace has been reconstructed
                recently due to damage from the Japanese occupation in the early 20th century but has been fully restored since then. The palace sits in front of the mountains of Bugak and 
                has remained as a hot tourist attraction in the north regions of Seoul.
